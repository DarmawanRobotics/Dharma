# Health

`dharma_health` turns the state of the robot into one typed signal. `health_monitor_node` runs
every check each second and publishes:

- `health/status` (`HealthStatus`, latched): `level` (`OK`, `WARN`, `ERROR`), `issues` (one line
  per problem, errors first) and `speed_scale` (0..1);
- `diagnostics` (`DiagnosticArray`): one status per checked item, `health: <item>`, for
  `rqt_robot_monitor`. Items stay listed when they recover.

```bash
ros2 topic echo /health/status
ros2 run rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor
```

- **Stamps, not only rates.** Topics are subscribed raw and the header stamp is read from the
  serialized bytes (a point cloud is never deserialized). A 10 Hz topic with 2 s old stamps is
  late.
- **TF diagnosis.** Each dynamic edge keeps its ages over a window. Late but steady ages mean a
  clock offset of the source (`camera_init->body 1.8 s old, steady (source clock offset?)`),
  varying ages mean load, a stamp that stops advancing a stopped publisher. See
  [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting).
- **Thermal zones** are read only when their type matches `system.thermal_zones` (CPU, GPU,
  junction, x86 package): some Jetson zones report bogus values.
- **Nodes** are named fully qualified (`/robot/control_mux_node`); the bringup adds every node it
  starts to `nodes.expected`.

## Speed scale

`speed_scale` is the lowest scale any finding asks for: an error asks for 0, a warning for the
lowest matching `degradation.rules` entry or `degradation.warn_scale` (1). The defaults halve the
speed while the LiDAR or the estimator is slow or late, or a TF edge is late:

```yaml
health_monitor_node:
  ros__parameters:
    degradation:
      rules: ["sensor:/livox/lidar=0.5", "sensor:/Odometry=0.5", "tf:*=0.5"]
```

The control mux applies it with `use_health_limit: true`; a health status older than
`health_timeout_sec` is ignored. Health is a diagnostic aid, not a safety function: the
protective field and the e-stop never depend on it.

## Configure

The product sets what to watch, e.g. in its stack file:

```yaml
health_monitor_node:
  ros__parameters:
    sensors:
      topics: ["/livox/lidar:5.0", "/Odometry:8.0", "/camera/color/camera_info:10.0:0.3"]
    tf:
      edges: ["camera_init->body"]
    clock:
      enabled: true
```

`topic:min_hz[:max_age_sec]` (max_age_sec 0: no stamp check). Do not list a camera image topic:
a raw subscription makes the driver encode every frame. Products add checks without forking: a
`Check` subclass registered in the `dharma_health.checks` entry point group and named in
`extra_checks`.
